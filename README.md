# fluffy-chainsaw :see_no_evil: 
Online VBScript Repo :)

## :heavy_check_mark: Task list  

- [x] Create repo and edit Readme
- [x] Create simple HTML to check environment
- [x] Create Basic UI that IE10 supports
- [x] Enter the questions

## :pushpin: Note: 
> Download the repo and run the index.html in IE browser.
During run time, allow the blocked content (Scripts/ActiveX) in order to execute the scripts. Even after enabling the 'Active X', if it doesn't work, then try the following :)

* Open the IE browser (I have IE11)
* Go to 'Developer tool' options (CTRL + U)
* Click on 'DOM Explorer' tab
* On the right side, change IE browser version to 10 or lower :)
